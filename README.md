# Project-3
Restaurant Review Website

2020-02-24
## Ivan: 1. wrote sudo code for potentially necessary functions;
      2. researched how to make ranking system with JS, wrote sudo code and examples for reference;
      3. researched where to get weather info, no REALLY FREE api yet...

## Kevin 1. I created the repo and sent a collaboration to Ivan and Jordan.
         2. I created a few branches through the day.
         3. I downloaded several images, placed them in the images folder, and added them to index.
         4. Researched how to add comments and score, which we most likely do with patch.
         5. Researched how to add total number of reviews and restaurants.  This will be dependent
            on the content of the API, when we receive it.
Jordan: 1. Built initial structure of HTML
        2. Linked google fonts
        3. Base styles begun
        4. Icons linked and made available
