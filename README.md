      1. I created the repo and sent a collaboration to Ivan and Jordan.
      2. I created a few branches through the day.
      3. I downloaded several images, placed them in the images folder, and added them to index.
      4. Researched how to add comments and score, which we most likely do with patch.
      5. Researched how to add total number of reviews and restaurants. This will be dependent on the content of the API, when we receive it.
